## Project 1: Improving profitability - Northwind distributor
### Overview:
This project focuses on a wholesale distributor operating in the B2B sector, primarily serving grocery stores, supermarkets, and restaurants. The business has established relationships with 91 customers across 21 countries and collaborates with 29 suppliers from 16 different countries. The company sells a portfolio of 77 products categorized into 8 distinct groups. With a team of 9 employees, it operates an online selling platform. The analysis covers data from June 1996 to April 1998, with 12 interconnected tables linked to 2,155 primary sales records.

### Objective:
The primary aim of this project is to present key insights and actionable recommendations that will enhance profitability by focusing on strengthening customer relationships, timely delivery of high-quality products, and achieving sustainable growth.

### Key Findings:

- A small segment of 13% of customers generates 50% of total revenue, highlighting a critical dependency.
- The abrupt cessation of orders from a key customer (ID: MEREP) calls for immediate investigation and re-engagement.
- Smaller orders (less than $1,000) constitute 50% of total orders but contribute only 16% to revenue, while larger orders (above $3,000) are significantly more impactful.
- Discontinuing three of the top ten products may adversely affect revenue and customer relationships.
- Customers purchasing a wider variety of products exhibit higher overall purchasing volumes.
- Product stock levels reveal a troubling discrepancy: many top-selling items are understocked while others are overstocked, leading to potential sales losses and cash flow issues.
- Current reorder point (ROP) settings do not effectively manage stock levels, with a concerning number of top products set to reorder at zero.

**Immediate Actions to Implement**

- Restock best-selling items that are low in inventory.
- Reactivate previously top-ranked products (IDs 29, 17, and 28) into the offerings.
- Investigate the reasons behind MEREP's order cessation and work to restore this relationship.
- Analyze previously high-ranking customers to identify factors contributing to their decreased order volume.
- Revamp inventory strategies by establishing a revised ROP system.
- Launch promotions to manage and reduce overstocked items.

**Strategic Recommendations**

- Develop loyalty programs and personalized support for top customers to foster deeper relationships.
- Cultivate engagement with lower-ranking customers to encourage increased orders.
- Separate shipping costs from product pricing to enhance market competitiveness.
- Offer free shipping contingent on minimum order values to incentivize larger purchases.
- Gradually introduce a minimum order threshold of $200 across customer segments.
- Maintain regular communication through newsletters for customer updates and product offers.
- Explore market expansion strategies to attract new customers.

## Project 2: HR Management Dashboard
### Overview
This is one of the projects I recently completed during my data analytics course. The dataset includes HR management data encompassing recruitment sources, employee performance metrics, diversity statistics, salaries, and employee satisfaction scores.
### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of the employee data to uncover insights regarding the effectiveness of the company's recruitment strategies, assess the diversity among employees, and identify the traits and characteristics associated with high-performing individuals within the organization. These findings will support initiatives aimed at enhancing recruitment practices, fostering diversity, and improving overall employee performance.
